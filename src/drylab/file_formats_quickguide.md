# File formats reference

Got a file? Not sure what file format to use? This is a quick guide to the
preferred formats.
It has the same information as [the file formats page](./extensions_and_formats.md)
but in a more condensed fashion.

- **Numbers**
  - Use [`csv`]().
  - Avoid using Excel (`.xlsx` or `.xls`).
- **Images**
  - Use [`TIFF`]() or [`PNG`]().
  - Avoid using `JPEG`.
- **Text Documents**
  - Use [plain text (`.txt`)]() or [markdown (`.md`)]().
  - For documents that machines would never need to read, you may use `.pdf`.
  - Avoid using Word-like files, `.docx` and `.doc`.
