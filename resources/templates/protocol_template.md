a footnote, like such:
- [John Doe](https://github.com/)[^contact] (list of roles)

Possible roles:
- Creator: the author(s) who actually wrote the protocol;
- Contributor: someone who helped write the protocol who is not quite an author.
- Proofreader: someone who read and corrected the protocol, but did not work
  on its invention.
- Validator: someone who experimentally tested the protocol.

- [@"your name"](@"author_orchid")[^contact] (creator);

[^contact]: Person to contact for more information about the protocol.

## General
### Scope of application
<!--
Detail here what the protocol does, what it can take as input and what it
will produce eventually.
-->

### Limitations
<!---
Detail here what the protocol cannot do, its practical limitations (e.g. a
limit in the concentration of detection, or specific requirements of input
samples such as purity).
Essentially all exceptions to the inputs above.
-->

### Timeframe
<!---
Detail here how long the protocol takes to complete, including both active
("at the bench") time and incubation ("idle") time.
Specify if the essay has to take place overnight.
-->

### Requirements
#### Input(s)
<!---
List here the inputs required for the protocol. If possible, re-use a term
from the list in <!!insert link!!>.

For each input item (if relevant) all possible attributes that can be seen in
the above list.
-->
- @"some item"
  - @"some attribute": @"some value"

#### Output(s)
<!--- Exactly the same as for Inputs. -->

- @"some item"
  - @"some attribute": @"some value"

#### Required equipment
<!--- Exactly the same as for Inputs. -->
- @"some item"
  - @"some attribute": @"some value"

#### Required Reagent
<!--- Exactly the same as for Inputs. -->
- @"some item"
  - @"some attribute": @"some value"

## Methods
